/*
 *	HINT
 *
 *	First of all, congrats on making it this far ðŸ¥³
 * 	Remember that all case sensitivty problems are solved 
 * 	when cases can be made the same, which is easily done in JS
 *  with .toUpp****se() you'll have to google for rest of command
 * 
 * 	As far as invalid goes, just specify some sort of default
 * 	condition when you check for various letters, where 
 * 	default can result in early return of -1
